### Hi there 👋 
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Motingliuu.Motingliuu) ![decription](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-green) ![decription](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Rust-blue) ![decription](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-red) 

I'm Moting Liu, a graduate student at Kyoto University, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning Systems.

I know there's still a long way to go, but I'm eager to keep learning and growing.

I'm currently seeking internship opportunities related to LLMs or ML systems. Please feel free to contact me! 😊
